# bayesian-optimization
This repo contains my work with Bayesian optimization and related topics. The
primary goal of this repo is to develop and curate a set of resources that
myself and others can use to better understand (and utilize) Bayesian
optimization.

## 📁 `docs`
This directory contains documents (i.e., tutorials) covering Bayesian
optimization and related topics.


## 📁 `examples`
This directory contains notebooks exploring various examples of Bayesian
optimization and its applications.
 * [Introduction to GPyTorch and GAUCHE](examples/gpytorch_and_gauche.ipynb)  
    This notebook synthesizes information from GPyTorch and GAUCHE's
    documentation regarding Gaussian processes for machine learning and how to
    apply them to irregular-structured input representations (i.e., molecular,
    graph, etc.).


## 📁 `slides`
This directory contains presentations covering Bayesian optimization and related
topics.

optimization and related topics. The BibTeX entries can be found in the
