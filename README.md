# bayesian-optimization
This repo contains my work with Bayesian optimization and related topics. The
primary goal of this repo is to develop and curate a set of resources that
myself and others can use to better understand (and utilize) Bayesian
optimization.

## üìÅ `docs`
This directory contains documents (i.e., notes, tutorials, etc.) covering
Bayesian optimization and related topics.
1. Introduction to Bayesian Optimization
2. Gaussian Processes
3. Model Assessment and Selection
4. Decision Theory
5. Utility Functions
6. Policies
7. Computing Policies
8. Implementation
9. Theoretical Analysis
10. History of Bayesian Optimization
11. Gaussian Process Regression
12. Gaussian Process Classification


## üìÅ `examples`
This directory contains notebooks exploring various examples of Bayesian
optimization and its applications.
 * [Introduction to GPyTorch and GAUCHE](examples/gpytorch_and_gauche.ipynb)  
    This notebook synthesizes information from GPyTorch and GAUCHE's
    documentation regarding Gaussian processes for machine learning and how to
    apply them to irregular-structured input representations (i.e., molecular,
    graph, etc.).

optimization and related topics. The BibTeX entries can be found in the
[`bibliography.bib`](bibliography.bib) file.
