# bayesian-optimization
This repo contains my work with Bayesian optimization and related topics. The
primary goal of this repo is to develop and curate a set of resources that
myself and others can use to better understand (and utilize) Bayesian
optimization.

## üìÅ `docs`
This directory contains documents (i.e., notes, tutorials, etc.) covering
Bayesian optimization and related topics.

* [**Introduction to Bayesian Optimization**](docs/01-introduction/main.pdf)
* **Gaussian Processes**
* **Covariance Functions (Kernels)**
* **Decision Theory**
* **Utility Functions**
* **Acquisition Functions**
* **Implementation**
* **Theoretical Analysis**
* **GP Regression**
* **GP Classification**


## üìÅ `examples`
This directory contains notebooks exploring various examples of Bayesian
optimization and its applications.
 * [**Introduction to GPyTorch and GAUCHE**](examples/gpytorch_and_gauche.ipynb)  
    _This notebook synthesizes information from GPyTorch and GAUCHE's_
    _documentation regarding Gaussian processes for machine learning and how to_
    _apply them to irregular-structured input representations (i.e., molecular,_
    _graph, etc.)._

optimization and related topics. The BibTeX entries can be found in the
[`bibliography.bib`](bibliography.bib) file.
