# Bayesian Optimization
This repo contains my work with Bayesian optimization and related topics. The
primary goal of this repo is to develop and curate a set of resources that
myself and others can use to better understand (and utilize) Bayesian
optimization.

## üìÅ `docs`
This directory contains notebooks consisting of notes and tutorials for Bayesian
optimization and related topics.

* [**Introduction to Bayesian Optimization**](docs/01_introduction.ipynb)
* **Gaussian Processes**

## üìÅ `examples`
This directory contains notebooks exploring various examples of Bayesian
optimization and its applications.
 * **Bayesian Statistics**
 * [**Introduction to GPyTorch and GAUCHE**](examples/gpytorch_and_gauche.ipynb)  
    _This notebook synthesizes information from GPyTorch and GAUCHE's_
    _documentation regarding Gaussian processes for machine learning and how to_
    _apply them to irregular-structured input representations (i.e., molecular,_
    _graph, etc.)._

## üìÅ `src`
This directory contains from-scratch implementations of Bayesian optimization
methods and the methods of related topics.
