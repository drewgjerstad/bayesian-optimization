    "### Theoretical Motivation\n",
    "Before we explore the applications of Bayesian optimization, we must consider\n",
    "the theoretical motivation for such an approach. The theoretical motivation\n",
    "typically stems from the form or type of _objective_ (the \"function\" we are\n",
    "aiming to optimize).\n",
    "\n",
    " * **Black-box objective functions** are functions that we can only interact\n",
    "   with via its inputs and outputs meaning typical methods do not work. However,\n",
    "   we can usually approximate such an objective and use Bayesian optimization to\n",
    "   manage the uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    " * **Expensive-to-evaluate objective functions** are functions that require\n",
    "   significant computation effort to obtain their output. However, once again,\n",
    "   we can approximate and model these efficiently using the Bayesian approach.\n",
    "\n",
    " * More generally, this approach is very useful when the objectives lack\n",
    "   analytical evaluation (or, if analytical evaluation is expensive).\n",
    "\n",
    " * In some spaces such as discrete or combinatorial, the objectives may not have\n",
    "   efficient gradients (if they exist) and so classical gradient-based\n",
    "   optimization methods are incompatible.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are additional supporting points to the theoretical motivation for\n",
    "Bayesian optimization but these seem to be the most common, especially with\n",
    "regard to the form and properties of the objective."
