    \textbf{Bayesian optimization} refers to an optimization method that uses
    Bayesian inference to guide the optimizer make ``better'' decisions.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This method achieves \emph{unparalleled} sample efficiency.
        \item A statistical model is used to approximate the objective function.
        \item \emph{Uncertainty} is inherent in optimization decisions, and
                uncertainty can be tackled via a Bayesian approach.
    \end{itemize}
