# Introduction
**Bayesian optimization** refers to an optimization approach that uses Bayesian
inference to guide the optimizer to make "better" decisions based on
_uncertainty_. In addition, this approach provides a framework that enables us
to strategically tackle the uncertainty inherent in all optimization decisions.
One particularly attractive property of this framework is its _unparalleled_
sample efficiency, a property we will discuss more in-depth later.

In these notes, the goal is to introduce Bayesian optimization from a high-level
perspective and introduce the components involved in the "Bayesian optimization
workflow". Additional notes discussing the components and related topics in
detail are available in the
[`bayesian-optimization`](https://github.com/drewgjerstad/bayesian-optimization)
repository and are linked below. We will begin with the motivation behind
Bayesian optimization, primarily focusing on the theoretical motivation and
examples of real-world Bayesian optimization applications.

# Motivation

## Theoretical Motivation
First, we consider the theoretical motivation for the Bayesian optimization
approach. Typically, the theoretical motivation steps from the form or type of
_objective_ (the "function" we are aiming to optimize). Note that the list below
is by no means exhaustive; there exists additional theoretical motivation but
these are seemingly the most common, particularly with regard to the form and
characteristics of the objective.

 * **Black-box objective functions** are functions that we can only interact
   with via its inputs and outputs meaning classical, analytical methods do not
   work. However, we can usually use Bayesian optimization to approximate such
   an objective and manage the inherent uncertainty.

 * **Expensive-to-evaluate objective functions** are functions that require
   significant computation effort to obtain their output. However, just as with
   black-box objectives, we can use Bayesian optimization to approximate and
   model these efficiently.

 * More generally, this approach is very useful when the objectives lack
   analytical evaluation (or, if analytical evaluation is expensive).

 * In some spaces such as the discrete or combinatorial ones, the objective may
   not have efficient gradients (if they exist). Thus, classical gradient-based
   optimization methods are incompatible.

## Applications
The application potential of Bayesian optimization can be seen across several
critical domains, especially those attempting to accelerate the identification
of solutions to real-world scientific and engineering problems. Some of these
applications include:

 * Drug discovery
 * Molecule/protein discovery
 * Materials design
 * AutoML (i.e., hyperparameter tuning)
 * Engineering decisions
 * Many more...

The diagrams in the next few sections are there to illustrate how the Bayesian
optimization approach is used in real-world applications. There will also be
commentary explaining why the approach is so useful in these applications. Just
as with the list above, this is not (in any way) an exhaustive review of
applications. Rather, the point of these sections is to showcase the real-world
motivation for this optimization approach.

\newpage
### Application: Drug Discovery
Figure 1 below shows an example of a chemical process optimization problem,
common in drug discovery. In the left half of the figure, four common
(classical) approaches are shown but these approaches are expensive.
Alternatively, the Bayesian optimization approach is shown in the right half.
That approach uses data from previous experiments to locate points that may
optimize the unknown objective, while strategically handling uncertainty in the
model. The located points will usually be used to plan future experiments as
they represent samples of _high utility_ (i.e., the point should be useful in
optimizing the reaction parameter).

Shields et al. (2021)](graphics/applications/drug-discovery.png){width=350}

### Application: Molecule/Protein Discovery
In the field of molecule and protein design, there are similar considerations to
the ones in the previous application: experiments are costly. Figure 2 shows the
integration of the Bayesian optimization approach with experimentation. In most
environments, scientists synthesize and test several different formulations to
obtain a dataset. This dataset is used to help model the underlying objective
and can be used to suggest new, promising formulations. Then, as shown in the
figure, the new formulations are synthesized, tested, and added to the dataset
so as to inform the model and optimizer of formulations to suggest next.

\newpage
### Application: Materials Discovery
Figure 3 is similar to the one for molecule/protein discovery but now it is
showcasing some additional details specific to materials design and discovery.
Again, the initial dataset is used to model the underlying objective and inform
design exploration, with results from design exploration being used to augment
the dataset. Additionally, in this particular example, the researchers also use
the experiments to assist in calibrating a simulation of designs, another
application of Bayesian optimization.

_Qualitative Variables_ by Zhang et al. (2020)](

### Application: AutoML
Figure 4 shows a workflow to tune neural network hyperparameters using Bayesian
optimization, specifically using a Gaussian process as a surrogate model. AutoML
is the process of automating the machine learning workflow and typically
includes tuning models' hyperparameters. We can use Bayesian optimization to
perform this tuning in a more efficient manner by identifying the next set of
promising hyperparameters based on the current model and its uncertainty.

Ortiz on _Medium_ (2020)](graphics/applications/automl.png){width=325}

\newpage
### Application: Engineering Decisions
Figure 5 shows how Bayesian optimization can be used to calibrate a particle
accelerator in a similar manner to the previous applications. The "operator"
inputs the target beam parameters while a camera inputs the observed beam
parameters. Then, Bayesian optimization determines the changes (i.e., the next
set of beam parameters) to ideally improve the calibration of the particle
accelerator.

# Optimization Foundations
**Optimization** is a process and field of study that aims to efficiently locate
the optimal objective value and/or its location from the search domain and its
corresponding objective values. In this section, we will introduce the
foundations of optimization to understand the ideas that Bayesian optimization
builds on. For a more thorough review of optimization, see Nocedal and Wright's
_Numerical Optimization_ book (in the Springer Series in Operations Research).

## Formalization of Optimization
Let's first formalize a typical optimization problem. This formulation is a
simple and flexible one for global optimization and is not inherently Bayesian.
Additionally, it is also formulating a _continuous_ optimization problem but
there exists other "types" of optimization other than just continuous.

\begin{equation*}
    x^* \in \argmax_{x \in \mathcal{X}} f(x)
    \hspace{36pt}
    f^* = \max_{x \in \mathcal{X}} f(x) = f(x^*)
\end{equation*}

where $f:\mathcal{X}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is a real-valued _objective function_
on some domain $\mathcal{X}$, $x^*$ is the point that obtains the global maximum
value $f^*$. Note that the $\max$ versus $\min$ is arbitrary and depends on the
specific problem.

_Black-box optimization_ arises from the fact that we do not need to have an
explicit objective function $f$ but rather only some information about the
objective at identified points.

The plot below shows an objective function with its _optima_ labeled. **Optima**
are the points that either maximize or minimize (optimize) the objective
function. The objective function plotted below is given by
\begin{equation*}
    f(x) = 10\sin(0.2x)\cos(0.1x) + \sin(0.5x) + 0.05x
\end{equation*}

```{python}
#| label: objective-with-optima
#| echo: false

def objective(x:np.array)->np.array:
    return (np.sin(0.2 * x) * np.cos(0.1 * x) * 10 +
            np.sin(0.5 * x) + 0.05 * x)

x = np.linspace(0, 50, 1000)
y = objective(x)

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 2))
plt.plot(x, y, label="Objective Function", c="gray", linestyle="--")
plt.scatter(x[np.argmax(y)], np.max(y), label="Global Max", c="r")
plt.scatter(x[np.argmin(y)], np.min(y), label="Global Min", c="r", marker="D")
plt.scatter(x[np.argmax(y[:200])], np.max(y[:200]), label="Local Max",
            c="k", marker="o")
plt.scatter(x[np.argmax(y[800:]) + 800], np.max(y[800:]), label="Local Max",
            c="k", marker="o")
plt.scatter(x[np.argmin(y[200:400]) + 200], np.min(y[200:400]),
            label="Local Min", c="k", marker="D")
plt.xlim((0, 75))
plt.title("Objective Function with Optima Labeled")
plt.xlabel("Observation")
plt.ylabel("Objective Value")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

In the plot on the previous page, the optima were found by obtaining the values of the
objective at every point in the _domain_. However, in optimization, we typically
want to avoid such computations due to its expensiveness and rather use methods
to find the optima in a more efficient manner. Furthermore, in the event we are
dealing with _black-box optimization_, recall that we don't necessarily have an
explicit objective but rather inputs and their corresponding outputs. That means
that evaluating the objective function at each point in the domain is not only
inefficient but effectively impossible.

## Objective Functions
The **objective function** is the function that we want to optimize. For some
problems, there is a mathematical model that can be developed to describe the
objective. However, in many real-world applications, there is no analytical or
mathematical model to describe the objective (one of the motivations for
Bayesian optimization).

Some objective functions are convex with only a single, unique global minimum
or maximum. Other functions are non-convex and might have several local optima
or a flat region with many saddle points. The plot below shows these three
general types of objectives.

```{python}
#| label: objective-fcn-types
#| echo: false

def objective_convex(x:np.array)->np.array:
    return 0.1*(x - 5)**2

def objective_non_convex(x:np.array)->np.array:
    return np.sin(2*x) * np.cos(x) * 10 + np.sin(0.5 * x) + 0.05 * x

def objective_non_convex_saddle(x:np.array)->np.array:
    return (x - 5)**3 - 100 * np.exp(-((x - 8)**2))

x = np.linspace(0, 10, 1000)

fig, ax = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=3, figsize=(16, 4))
ax[0].plot(x, objective_convex(x))
ax[0].set_title("Convex with\n Unique Optima")
ax[1].plot(x, objective_non_convex(x))
ax[1].set_title("Non-Convex with\nSeveral Optima")
ax[2].plot(x, objective_non_convex_saddle(x))
ax[2].set_title("Non-Convex with\nSaddle Points")
for i in range(len(ax)):
    ax[i].set_xlabel("Observation")
    ax[i].set_ylabel("Objective Value")
plt.show()
```

While the plots showing non-convex objective functions pose difficulty to
efficiently optimize such functions, there are other characteristics (listed
below) of objective functions common in Bayesian optimization that also lead to
issues.

 * The objective is considered to be a _black-box_ function meaning we can
   only interact with the objective via its inputs and outputs.

 * The objective's returned value is _corrupted_ by some sort of noise and does
   not represent the exact true objective value at that location.

 * The objective has a _high cost_ of evaluation and requires a sample efficient
   method to avoid expensive probing.

 * There _do not exist gradients_ (if we did, efficient gradient-based methods
   could be employed to locate and evaluate optima).

## Observation Models
Observation models are similar to the idea of surrogate models used in the
Bayesian optimization workflow but there are some key differences. The
observation model is used to describe how the true objective is _observed_,
usually accounting for some form of (additive) noise. On the other hand, the
surrogate model is a probabilistic model (i.e., Gaussian process) used to
approximate the unknown objective function.

Specifically, the **observation model** is an approach to formalize the
relationship between the true objective function, the actual observation, and
the noise. This is rather important since the model used to relate the true
objective and actual observations must account for uncertainty due to noise.
Mathematically, this is the probability distribution of $y$ given the sample
location $x$ and true objective function $f$:

\begin{equation*}
    p(y \vert f, x)
\end{equation*}

To account for uncertainty, we assume that the observations are _stochastically_
dependent on the objective. Mathematically, we assume an additive noise term
$\varepsilon$:

\begin{equation*}
    y = f(x) + \varepsilon
\end{equation*}

Let $\varepsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$. Then, the model becomes:

\begin{equation*}
    p(y \vert x, f, \sigma) = \mathcal{N}(y; f, \sigma^2)
\end{equation*}

Thus, the observation $y$ at sample location $x$ is treated as a _random_
_variable_ which follows a Gaussian, or normal, distribution with mean $f$ and
variance $\sigma^2$. This leads to the distribution of $y$ being centered around
the true objective value at sample location $x$, $f(x)$.

```{python}
#| label: observation-model-example
#| echo: false

def true_objective(x:np.array)->np.array:
    return np.sin(0.75 * x)

def observation(x:np.array, sd:float)->np.array:
    return true_objective(x) + np.random.normal(0, sd, x.shape)

x = np.linspace(0, 10, 1000)
samples = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)

plt.figure(figsize=(16, 3))
plt.plot(x, true_objective(x), label="True Objective", c="b")
plt.scatter(samples, observation(samples, sd=0.5), label="Observations", c="k")
plt.title("Observation Model Example")
plt.xlabel("Observation")
plt.ylabel("Objective Value")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

In the plot above, the true objective is shown in addition to 100 observations
that have an additive term of random (Gaussian, or normal) noise. The
observation model will need to take this into account since noise, often called
_uncertainty_ in Bayesian optimization, is inherent in real-world problems. It
can come from measurement errors, environmental factors, or simply the
randomness in the system being optimized.

## Optimization Policies
In simple terms, the optimization policy handles the repeated interactions
between the "inner-workings" of the policy and the environment, with the
environment typically being _noise-corrupted_ (hence the need for an observation
model).

More definitively, a **policy** is a mapping function that takes in a new input
observation plus any existing observations and uses a _principled_ sampling
approach to output the next observation location. It will also decide if it
should perform another iteration (select a new observation) or terminate the
optimization process (see _Termination Policies_ below).

For most applications, we want the policy to ideally be learning and improving
such that it will guide the search toward the global optimum more effectively.
Furthermore, the iterative policy improvement should lead to a good policy that
retains the (typically limited) sampling budget for more promising candidate
points. A policy that does not consider observed data are known as a
_non-adaptive_ policy and is not ideal for costly observations.

Note that in some literature, there is little distinction between the
optimization policy and the termination policy (discussed next). To be clear,
the termination policy is one of the several components that make up the
optimization policy. This lack of distinction is not unreasonable but rather
something to be aware of when reviewing the vast literature on optimization.

## Termination Policies
A **termination policy** is the final decision in the optimization loop. The
policy decides whether to terminate immediately or continue with another
observation (continue to optimize the objective). Such policies can be
_deterministic_ or _stochastic_.

 * A **deterministic termination policy** is one that will stop the optimization
   process after reaching a goal or exhausting a pre-defined search budget.

 * A **stochastic termination policy** is one that will depend on the observed
   data and some level of randomness or probability.

Note that this piece of the optimization process can be handled by an external
agent or be dynamic (i.e., a deterministic or stochastic termination policy).
For the purposes of this notebook, we will not focus on specific termination
policies here. This is primarily due to the fact that the termination policy
depends heavily on the approach or method and the problem/application.

\newpage
# Bayesian Foundations
Before we venture into the world of Bayesian optimization, we must first review
some foundations of Bayesian statistics. For a more comprehensive examination of
Bayesian statistics, the reader is referred to _Mathematical Statistics and_
_Data Analysis_ by John A. Rice or _Bayesian Optimization_ by Roman Garnett
(which provides an optimization-focused review).

## Bayesian Statistics
**Bayesian statistics** provide us with a systematic and quantitative approach
to reason about uncertainty using probabilities. Thus, in _Bayesian_
optimization, we use _Bayesian_ statistics to reason about uncertainty in the
observation (or surrogate) model.

One of the central concepts in Bayesian statistics is **Bayesian inference**.
Bayesian inference uses Bayes' theorem to reason about how the prior
distribution $p(\theta)$, the likelihood $p(\text{data}\vert\theta)$, and the
posterior distribution $p(\theta\vert\text{data})$ interact with each other.
Note that $\theta$ represents the parameter of interest.

Recall **Bayes' theorem**:
\begin{equation*}
    p(\theta\vert\text{data}) = \frac{p(\text{data}\vert\theta)p(\theta)}
        {p(\text{data})}
\end{equation*}

Let's take a step back and break this down. First, Bayesian inference is a
framework that allows us to infer uncertain features of a system of interest
from observations using the laws of probability. Thus, within this framework,
all unknown quantities are denoted by _random variables_. This is convenient as
we can express our beliefs using probability distributions reflecting plausible
values.

The **prior distribution**, $p(\theta)$, represents our beliefs before we
observe any data. For instance, if we believe that the data is normally
distributed then we would likely define the prior distribution to be the
Gaussian normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$.

Then, we can refine our initial beliefs once we have observed some data using
the **likelihood function**, $p(\text{data}\vert\theta)$. The likelihood
function, or likelihood, provides the distribution of observed values ($y$)
given the location ($x$), and values of interest ($\theta$).

Finally, using the observed value $y$, we can derive the **posterior**
**distribution**, $p(\theta\vert\text{data})$, using Bayes' theorem (defined
above) where $\text{data} = (x, y)$. This so-called posterior distribution acts
as a "compromise" between our initial beliefs from the prior and our
observations from the likelihood. It is at the heart of Bayesian optimization
and is used to update the surrogate model as we acquire additional observations.

## Bayesian Inference of the Objective Function
The primary use of Bayesian inference in Bayesian optimization is to reason
about the uncertainty in the objective function. Specifically, the probabilistic
belief we use over the objective function is called a _stochastic process_. A
**stochastic process** is a probability distribution over an infinite collection
of random variables, for example, the objective function value at each point in
the domain.

We will use a **prior process**, $p(f)$, to express our assumptions (beliefs)
that we may have about the objective function. Then, we can define a stochastic
process using the distribution of the function values $\boldsymbol{\phi}$ given
a finite set of points $\boldsymbol{x}$:

\begin{equation*}
    p(\boldsymbol{\phi}\vert\boldsymbol{x})
\end{equation*}

The "gold standard" stochastic process used in Bayesian optimization is the
**Gaussian process** due to its expressivity and flexibility, in addition to the
fact that many of these finite-dimensional distributions are multivariate
Gaussian (or approximately so).

Let's now return to discussing how Bayesian inference is applied over the
objective. Suppose we make a set of observations at locations $\boldsymbol{x}$
with corresponding values $\boldsymbol{y}$. Let
$\mathcal{D} = (\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{y})$ be the dataset of aggregated
observations. Bayesian inference will account for these observations via the
formation of the **posterior process**, akin to the posterior predictive
distribution:

\begin{equation*}
    p(f\vert\mathcal{D}) = \int p(f\vert\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{\phi})
    p(\boldsymbol{\phi}\vert\mathcal{D})\hspace{2pt}\text{d}\boldsymbol{\phi}
\end{equation*}

\newpage
# The Bayesian Approach
The "Bayesian approach", particularly in the context of optimization, refers to
a philosophical approach that uses Bayesian inference to reason about
uncertainty. Specifically, the Bayesian approach enables us to tackle the
inherent uncertainty in optimization decisions which is crucial since our
decisions will determine our success. This is accomplished through a systematic
reliance on probability laws and Bayesian inference during optimization.

Recall that the objective function is viewed as a random variable that will be
informed by our prior expectations and posterior observations. The Bayesian
approach will play an active role in the optimization process to guide the
optimization policy by evaluating the merit of a candidate observation. This
results in **uncertainty-aware optimization policies**.

## Uncertainty-Aware Optimization Policies
The optimization policy determines the decisions made during the optimization
process. To reasonably handle the uncertainty of the objective function, the
policy should use the available data to determine the successive observation
locations optimally. There is only one requirement from ourselves: we need to
establish our preferences for what data or what "kind" of data we want to
acquire. Then, we design the policy to maximize such preferences.

Clearly, this will require some sort of framework to make decisions in this way,
especially in the face of uncertainty. A natural choice is **Bayesian decision**
**theory** which will be discussed in more detail in another set of notes (see
the _Additional Notes_ section).

As we continue to explore Bayesian optimization and uncertainty-aware policies,
a common theme will begin to emerge: all Bayesian optimization policies handle
the uncertainty in the objective function in a uniform manner, a property that
is defined implicitly within an optimal _acquisition function_.

\newpage
# Bayesian Optimization Workflow
The Bayesian optimization workflow consists of two main _primitives_: the
surrogate model and the acquisition function. In this section, we will briefly
discuss these two primitives to understand how they fit into this workflow. Note
that these topics will be discussed in-depth in other notes (see the
_Additional Notes_ section).

## Surrogate Models
**Surrogate models** are the models we use in Bayesian optimization to express
our beliefs and knowledge about the objective function. While in certain
literature the term _observation model_ is used interchangeably with _surrogate_
_model_, they are distinguishable. For instance, if we have a mathematical
formulation of the objective then we refer to the model that relates the
observations and the objective as an _observation model_. However, if we do
not know the underlying structure of the objective then we refer to the model as
a _surrogate model_ since it acts as a surrogate and "takes the place" of the
objective function. The surrogate model is used within the posterior process to
quantify the probabilities of observations in conjunction with utility
functions. Therefore, it is a powerful tool when we are reasoning about both the
uncertainty and utility of candidate observations.

As mentioned before, we use a _stochastic process_ to characterize the objective
function and the gold standard in Bayesian optimization is the _Gaussian_
_process_. In fact, one of the most common choices for surrogate models is the
Gaussian process due to its flexibility, expressivity, and sufficient
uncertainty quantification properties. We will discuss Gaussian processes in
greater detail in other notes (see _Additional Notes_ section).

## Acquisition Functions
**Acquisition functions** assign a score to candidate observations where the
score represents an observation's potential benefit during optimization.
Ideally, acquisition functions are cheap to evaluate and address the
_exploitation-exploration tradeoff_. In the context of optimization,
_exploitation_ refers to sampling where the objective value is expected to be
large whereas _exploration_ refers to sampling where we are more uncertain
about the objective value. Another useful property of an acquisition function is
it vanishes at pre-existing observations as there is no sense in sampling twice.

There are two main types of acquisition functions: myopic and look-ahead. Myopic
acquisition functions consider only the immediate utility while look-ahead
acquisition functions consider longer-term utility. This will be discussed
further in the notes covering Bayesian decision theory. Regardless of the type,
the optimization policy should be designed to maximize the acquisition function
such that the candidate observation with the most potential benefit is selected.
